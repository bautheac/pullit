\arguments{
\item{active_contract_tickers}{A chatacter vector. Specifies the Bloomberg futures active contract tickers to query data for.
Defaults to 'C A Comdty', the Bloomberg active contract ticker for the XCBT corn futures series.}

\item{start}{A scalar character vector. Specifies the starting date for the query in the following format: 'yyyy-mm-dd'.
Defaults to '2018-01-01'.}

\item{end}{A scalar character vector. Specifies the end date for the query in the following format: 'yyyy-mm-dd'.
Defaults to '2018-06-30'.}

\item{verbose}{A logical scalar vector. Should progression messages be printed? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{file}{A scalar chatacter vector. Specifies the target \code{storethat} SQLite database file.}

\value{
An S4 object of class \code{\linkS4class{FuturesAggregate}} with slots:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{tickers}: a character vector. Active contract Bloomberg tickers for which data has been found.}
    \item{\code{fields}: a tibble. Columns include:
      \itemize{
        \item{\code{active contract ticker}: futures active contract Bloomberg tickers for which data has been found.}
        \item{\code{field}: futures Bloomberg aggregate data fields for which data has been found.}
      }
    }
    \item{\code{data}: a tibble. Columns inlude:
      \itemize{
        \item{\code{active contract ticker}: futures active contract Bloomberg tickers for which data has been found.}
        \item{\code{field}: Bloomberg aggregate data fields for which data has been found.}
        \item{\code{date}: observation date.}

\description{
Provided with a set of Bloomberg futures active contract tickers and a time period,
  retrieves the corresponding futures historical aggregate data previously stored in a \code{storethat}
  SQLite database. For each individual field, futures aggregate data represents the aggregation of the
  corresponding field values over all the corresponding term structure contracts.
