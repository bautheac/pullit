Although self-contained with consumption value on its own, [pullit](https://bautheac.github.io/pullit/) is one of the workhorses for data ETL (extract, transform, load) work in the [finRes](https://bautheac.github.io/finRes/) suite where it plays the very important role of interface to Bloomberg. Using carefully selected Bloomberg datafields from [BBGsymbols](https://bautheac.github.io/BBGsymbols/) in tandem with @Armstrong_Rblpapi's Bloomberg interface it facilitates Bloomberg data queries for the R user.  
Install the development version from github with `devtools::install_github("bautheac/pullit")`. 


## finRes

### BBGsymbols
[pullit](https://bautheac.github.io/pullit/) queries Bloomberg for historical as well as contemporaneous data for multiple types of financial instruments using fields provided by [BBGsymbols](https://bautheac.github.io/BBGsymbols/) and returns the retrieved data in formats that are easy to work with.  

### plotit
[finRes](https://bautheac.github.io/finRes/) provides a set of accessors and summary methods for these objects while [plotit](https://bautheac.github.io/plotit/) provides bespoke visualization tools.  

### storethat
Financial data retrieved using [pullit](https://bautheac.github.io/pullit/) can be stored using the [storethat](https://bautheac.github.io/storethat/) package for subsequent access with no active Bloomberg connection needed. Retrieving previously stored data from a [storethat](https://bautheac.github.io/storethat/) database using [pullit](https://bautheac.github.io/pullit/) is fairly similar to retrieving it from Bloomberg. The corresponding functions only differ in name with their prefix referring to the data source (storethat vs. Bloomberg); the parameters are equal.
