## pullit!

Although self-contained with consumption value on its own, pullit is one of the workhorses of the [finRes](https://bautheac.github.io/finRes/) suite where it plays the very important role of interface to Bloomberg. Using carefully selected Bloomberg datafields from [BBGsymbols](https://bautheac.github.io/BBGsymbols/) in tandem with @Armstrong_Rblpapi_2018's Bloomberg interface it makes pulling financial data from Bloomberg rather easy for the R user. Install the development version from github with `devtools::install_github("bautheac/pullit")`. 

## finRes

### BBGsymbols
pullit queries Bloomberg for historical as well as contemporaneous data for multiple types of financial instruments using fields provided by BBGsymbols and returns the retrieved data in formats that are easy to work with.  

### plotit
finRes provides a set of accessors and summary methods for these objects while [plotit](https://bautheac.github.io/plotit/) provides bespoke visualization tools.  

### storethat
Financial data retrieved using pullit can be stored using [storethat](https://bautheac.github.io/storethat/) for subsequent access whith no active Bloomberg connection needed. storethat uses a bespoke database design for easy and fast access where the data can be stored locally or remotely for global access, in a cloud for example. Retrieving previously stored data from a storethat database using pullit is fairly similar to retrieving it from Bloomberg. The corresponding functions only differ in name with their prefix refering to the data source (storethat vs. Bloomberg); the parameters are equal.
